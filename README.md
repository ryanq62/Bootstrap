# Bootstrap

5 flexible elements:

1. Tables
2. Alerts
3. Buttons
4. Cards
5. Carousel
(I added many others as well, these were just some of the main ones.)

2 open elements:

1. Customized Spinner using CSS, as well as used jquery to make it dissapear and make an alert appear. 
2. Tooltips on the button hyperlinks.
